# Lightbox for Bootstrap 5
A Bootstrap 5 lightbox written in pure ES6 JavaScript that supports images, galleries, YouTube, Vimeo, and Instagramâ€”built around Bootstrap's Modal and Carousel plugins.

Have you been using [Lightbox for Bootstrap (ekko-lightbox)](https://github.com/ashleydw/lightbox) but recently moved to Bootstrap 5? This is your replacement.

Documentation: https://trvswgnr.github.io/bs5-lightbox/

## Installation
##### Install with NPM:
```shell
npm i bs5-lightbox
```

Lightbox for Bootstrap 5 will automatically initialize on import:
```js
import 'bs5-lightbox'
```
By default it will target elements with the `data-toggle-"lightbox"` attribute.

If you want to target a different element, import the `Lightbox` class and instantiate it:
```js
import Lightbox from 'bs5-lightbox'

const lightbox = new Lightbox('.my-lightbox-toggle')
```
